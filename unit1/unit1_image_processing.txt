Introduction to Image Processing:
Image processing is the manipulation of images through various methods such as filtering, enhancement, segmentation, compression, etc., to 
achieve specific goals like improving the quality, removing noise, or extracting meaningful information. It plays a crucial role in various
fields like computer vision, medical imaging, remote sensing, biometrics, and more.

Images, Pixels, Image resolution, PPI and DPI:
An image is a representation of an object or a scene as a two-dimensional array of pixels. Each pixel represents the color or intensity at 
that specific point in the image. Image resolution refers to the level of detail that can be shown in an image. It is measured in pixels 
per inch (PPI) for digital images and lines per millimeter (lpm or lpi) for printed images. PPI stands for Pixels Per Inch, while DPI (Dots
Per Inch) was historically used to indicate the resolution of printers. However, with the growth of digital media, the terms have become 
interchangeable in common usage.

Bitmap Images:
Bitmap images, also known as raster graphics or simply bitmaps, are digital images that use a grid of pixels to represent the image. They 
can be saved in various formats such as BMP, JPEG, PNG, GIF, etc. Bitmap images can suffer from resolution dependence because they do not 
have the ability to resize without losing quality or introducing artifacts.

Lossless Compressions:
Lossless compression is a type of image compression that allows for the exact reproduction of the original image after decompression. It 
achieves this by identifying redundant data and patterns within the image, and then encoding and compressing the data accordingly. Some 
common lossless formats include PNG (Portable Network Graphics) and TIFF (Tagged Image File Format).

Lossy Compression:
Lossy compression, on the other hand, involves the removal of certain details from an image to reduce its file size. This is done by 
discarding information that is less significant or can be reconstructed without significantly impacting the overall quality of the image. 
JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) and WebP are examples of lossy compression formats.

Image File Formats:
There are various image file formats, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. Some common ones include:

1. JPG/JPEG - A popular format for storing photographs due to its high compression ratio, but it suffers from loss of quality during 
compression.
2. PNG - Supports both lossless (compressed) and semi-lossy (filtered) compression, making it suitable for images with text or intricate 
details.
3. GIF - Primarily used for simple images like logos, icons, or cartoons due to its limited color palette and is known for supporting 
animations.
4. BMP - A uncompressed format that retains the original image quality but has larger file sizes.
5. TIFF - Offers high-quality images and supports both lossless and lossy compression, making it ideal for professional use.

Color Spaces:
A color space defines the range of colors that can be represented in an image. The most common color spaces are RGB (Red, Green, Blue) and 
CMYK (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Black). While RGB is more suitable for digital media as it represents colors additively, CMYK is better suited
for printing purposes since it uses subtractive processes.

Advanced Image Concepts:
Advanced image processing techniques include topics like morphological operations, filtering (median, Gaussian), segmentation 
(thresholding, region-growing), feature detection (Sobel, Canny edge detectors, etc.), and more. These concepts are useful in various 
applications such as object recognition, face detection, document analysis, medical imaging, remote sensing, and more.

Basics of Python and Scikit image:
Python is a popular high-level programming language that offers simple syntax, easy readability, and extensive libraries. It provides a 
solid platform for image processing tasks due to its flexibility and powerful packages like NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. Among these, 
Scikit-image (Scikit-image) is a significant package used for various image processing functions. Some basic functions include loading 
images using the `imread()` function, performing rotations, shifts, and scaling with the `transform()`, and `similarity_transforms()` 
functions.

Determining structural similarity:
Structural Similarity (SSIM) is a method used to measure the perceptual quality of images or videos. It compares two images and evaluates 
their structural similarity by considering three factors - luminance, contrast, and structure. SSIM can be useful in applications like 
image compression, denoising, or video coding where preserving image quality is important. In Python, the SSIM function from Scikit-image 
package can be used to determine structural similarity between two images.
